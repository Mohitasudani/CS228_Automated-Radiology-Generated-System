Main Project and multiple mini-projects involved in the course

Medical imaging, which includes X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, plays a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, producing these images can be time-consuming and prone to errors due to the specialized training and expertise required for accurate interpretation. To address this challenge, we are developing automated systems capable of generating radiology reports from medical images with minimal human intervention. This innovative approach aims to reduce the time and resources needed for report generation while improving the accuracy and consistency of interpreting medical images. Additionally, implementing automated systems would allow healthcare professionals to allocate more time to crucial tasks, such as patient care. During our endeavor, we encountered several obstacles. Firstly, each patient had multiple types of information, necessitating the identification of relevant features. Secondly, some patients lacked finding reports in the dataset. Thirdly, the number of images varied among patients, with some having four images while others had two. Furthermore, the report texts were generally lengthy, with 99 percent of the data having a length of 79.0 words. Consequently, we processed the data accordingly.
